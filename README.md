Hello! This is my book review app that was created with the react.js framework. It incorporates AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. 
The static contect is hosted on S3, with CloudFront for caching. This will allow your application to handle incoming traffic. 
Make sure you have the correct path defined for your lambda function codes.
